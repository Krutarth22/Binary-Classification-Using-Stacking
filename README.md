# Binary-Classification-Using-Stacking

The objective here is build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.
Here the Python code performs Binary Classification by stacking 2 boosting algorithms and using Logistic Regression as the predictor algorithm.
The Note book exhibits Exploratory Data Analysis and feature engineering processes.
